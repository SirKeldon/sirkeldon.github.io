# Lilith

Yet another snake game

# What is this?

This is just an exercise to code one of the most classy games ever appeared, one that for many of us gave lot of hours in front of the first cellphones. Never used requestAnimationFrame nor canvas, so this game was the perfect candidate to do it.

Business logic is splitted so the snake is controlled 100% by its own module, then another part controls how the canvas is repainted (tried to minimize the impact on the user's browser) The final goal is to migrate this to an -almost- functional programming which is a pending task to do.

# How to run the game?

Clone the repo and be sure to launch the project files within a server of your choice (you can use Live Web Server plugin from VSCode to avoid any further installations)

Once it's done, point to "http://your-path-for-the-game/index.html" and follow on-screen instructions.
